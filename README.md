# process_ghost

Hello brothers right now i am working in a project of Process Ghosting and i use the POC of here https://github.com/hasherezade/process_ghosting, 
I do the translate to RUST but when i Trie to work with NtCreateThreadEx i got this error Access Violation from the execution... 
So i only get this information: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/kk1p9z/access_violation_error_when_injecting_dll_with_cc/ and says it's 
impossible use this function on rust?
